### README for sway_mindark theme by arl

The mindark theme is a minimalistic dark theme. It provides an energy-saving, elegant and destraction free environment.

The theme sets the design and includes a well integrated application launcher (default mod+d), a screenshot menu that enables taking screenshots of certain containers (default F12), a session manager (default mod+shift+e) and a statusbar (displayed when mod is pressed).

Copy the folder "sway" to ~/.config/sway and edit the config files and scripts according to your setup.

See through all files and edit according to your setup. It's all explained. The default is a desktop PC with one display called HDMI-A-1 and all dependencies installed, that can sleep-and-hibernate. You can set the theme to portable devices.

All scripts are straight forward, easy to understand and manipulate.

It is important to install the dependencies or to disable the correlating features:
swaylock, bemenu for overall usage
grim, imv, jq, slurp for screenshots
iw, pamixer, awk for the status command
pactl and playerctl for media-keybinds (disabled by default)

Recommended file-manager is nnn, it's fast. Recommended for pdf-viewer is llpp (toggle dark with -I), it's fast.

If not by default, set your terminal background to solid black. The theme also looks good with transparent terminals and a nice wallpaper.
